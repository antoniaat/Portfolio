<h1>About me</h1>

<p>My name is Antonia Atanasova and I am studying <b>Software Engineering</b> in <a href="https://softuni.bg"
                                                                                    target="_blank">Software
    University </a>and <b>Business Informatics</b> in
    <a href="https://www.unwe.bg/" target="_blank">University of National and World Economy</a>, both of them based in
    Sofia, Bulgaria. </p>

<p>Currently I am working like Team Lead and Technical Trainer at <a href="https://softuni.bg"
                                                                     target="_blank">SoftUni</a> and <b>Digital
    Marketing/Web Development Freelancer.</b></p>

<p> If you love your business as much as I love my job, we're off to a good start! With YOUR VISION and my experience,
    we can create something that engages your audience. I design <b>beautiful, effective websites</b> with clean, modern
    and
    simple design. You can trust that I will communicate promptly, deadlines are kept and budgets are respected. I'm
    passionate about simplicity, building user-friendly websites, achieved through good design.</p>

<p>I am also a <b>Member Of The Management Board</b> in <a href="http://ybcbulgaria.com" target="_blank">Youth Business
    Club</a>, which is a non - profit organisation which works
    for the empowerment of students to have more opportunities to meet business experts and professionals.</p>
